# FracCalc Project

The FracCalc project is a fraction calculator allowing users to perform arithmetic operations on fractions and get fractions as output (instead of decimals).

The project can be solved in 250-300 lines of java code, though students often write much more verbose solutions. The canonical version of the project is divided into 3 checkpoints and a final submission.
